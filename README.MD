# Fine-tuning the Florence-2 using multiple GPUs

This repository is intended for learning purposes, helping people understand the process of fine-tuning the Florence-2 model. It retains only the essential functionality for multi-GPU training, stripping away most non-critical features. This repository heavily references the [Hugging Face blog on fine-tuning Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/blog/finetune-florence2), with the multi-GPU training code expanded using ChatGPT and all bugs manually removed.
